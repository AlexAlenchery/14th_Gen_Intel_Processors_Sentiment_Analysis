"R502RF7DUUKBT","Chris H","I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715ewfylApL.jpg

"R2FLCRTOTFGFTM","Deven","This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

"R29AWRHLI4MVWV","Austin","A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80⁰ occasionally, for a very brief moment.

"RPJDOZU4NH0XO","JZ the reviewer","I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3.

Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2024","IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7125D4RdR9L.jpg

I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","Much faster than my previous i7-6850k","5.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Processor","Core™ i9-14900K"

"RGWWVLEZTYN3L","elviscera","Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.

He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","So far so good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","29","Processor","Core™ i9-14900K"

"RURPTO0OXHNCD","Amazon lover","So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2023","Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease","5.0 out of 5 stars","","73","Processor","Core™ i9-14900KF"

I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable.

"R3E3ZCB7W9I1J0","J","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.

"RMHWL2Q0WQPJ7","Eric Heuyard","The 13th and 14th gen intel cpu chips are notorious for being unstable and low quality. While installation is easy, the chip may come with deficiencies that get worse over time.For the first couple months after install i would experience BSoD crashes and i was trying to diagnose. Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD.

"RN2YPTX2TQC5T","Christopher","purchased the i9 CPU six months ago with high expectations for top-tier performance. Initially, it lived up to those expectations, running smoothly for about four months. However, my experience took a turn for the worse when instability issues began to plague my system.Games started crashing randomly to the desktop, and I encountered frustrating VRAM errors in Fortnite, which are known issues with 13th and 14th gen i9 CPUs. I soon realized that my motherboard's default settings were likely to blame, as they inadvertently cooked my CPU, causing it to degrade rapidly over a short period. Despite my efforts to disable overclocking features like ASUS Multicore Enhancement, the motherboard continued to apply overclocks, exacerbating the problem.In response to widespread complaints, Intel and motherboard manufacturers released BIOS updates touted to fix the issue by reducing power limits, known as the Intel Baseline Defaults profile. Initially, this seemed to restore stability to my system, but the respite was short-lived. After about a month, the same issues resurfaced, casting doubt on the effectiveness of the solution.I am currently dealing with Intel support over this CPU, and I have a case number with them as we work to resolve the ongoing issues. The fact that these issues are still ongoing and Intel is actively investigating the root cause speaks to the severity and complexity of the problem.Based on my experience and the prevalence of similar issues, I urge potential buyers to think carefully before investing in the i9 CPU. Considering the reported stability of i7 CPUs, it may be a safer choice for those prioritizing reliability.","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024","i9 CPU Instability and Degradation - Buyer Beware","1.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31K4AKRGQJL.jpg

The worst part of all this is a crap shoot if I receive an actual working chip back. Again, it does not appear to be the chip itself but the instruction/algorithm Intel uses.Motherboard manufacturers are allowing these chips, by default, to run off the rails. Intel's power spec is 253W. When I checked the BIOS on my motherboard(s), they come by default set to run at just under 5000W! Are you kidding me?

I do not see the average consumer having any understanding of why their rig is acting like a crazy person.Anyway, just do yourselves a favor and take a big ol' pass on these chips.

This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot.

"R330GDX361WY0O","Nick Gallant","I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.","Reviewed in Canada on May 3, 2024","until the kinks are worked out, not even a little bit worth the price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Processor","Core™ i9-14900K"

My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone.

This is not a new generation so intel should have done what they have done in the past and call this a 13990k or even 13970k like they did back in the Devils Canyon release (4790k upgraded from 4770k)on a 13900k if you unlock the TDP limits through features like Asus Multicore Enhancement (or manually remove the TDP limits) it basically performs within margin of error of the 14900k stock limits if not beats it on longer test when Intel limits are reached (10min loop of Cinebench R23 for example).If you unlock the limits of the 14900k you start getting thermal throttling with high core count benchmarks and then it actually can perform worse than the 13900k with unlocked limits because the 13900k will hold 5.5ghz but the 14900k will bounce between 5.2-5.6ghz.I had to set the power use limits to 320w in the BIOS to get it to reliably match or sometimes beat the 13900k with unlocked TDP limits.Where this CPU can shine is if you are into undervolting. I suspect there is some headroom there.If you are air cooling the CPU or even a 240mm AIO you probably need to keep this on the stock intel TDP limits and would be fine.To really get the most out of the 14900k I would say you need a custom loop, otherwise just get a 13900k and unlock the TDP limits with a 360mm AIO cooler. Still 4 stars because it is basically a 13900k. I would give the 13900k 5 stars.If the 14900k was much more expensive I would probably downgrade it to a 3 star CPU.

"R11D7BFB2QWA6Q","Maxwell Syndstrom","The 14900K is a great CPU, with an advanced architecture not reflected in current benchmarking practices.My only caution would be to run it with stock settings on a top quality Z790 motherboard, and to make sure you test it thoroughly to insure you don’t have a defective copy. Even with all the built in protections, and Intel’s own Extreme Tuning Utility software support (downloadable for free on their website), the chances are very high trying to overclock this CPU — even just using straight XMP I settings in BIOS — will result in sustained system instabilities. The design is intrinsically already pushed close to the limit by default. Any attempts to “increase” performance is likely to lead to little real gain and a lot of crashing and lockups.I consider all the overclocking stuff, for CPU, RAM at 8GHz, etc. sheer marketing at this point. It’s possible to hotrod it all, safely, but that’s really only useful for benchmarking competitions.Test yours when you get it thoroughly; return it immediately if it demonstrates any anomalies, and you’ll love its performance.Meteor Lake next! Then on to Arrow Lake and other imminent advances in the works.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2024","Super fast CPU - Skip Overclocking it","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Processor","Core™ i9-14900KF"

This 20-core powerhouse purrs like a kitten under normal workloads, staying surprisingly cool thanks to its 7nm architecture. But don't be fooled by its initial demeanor  this CPU is a wolf in sheep's clothing, ready to tear through any demanding games and content creation tasks with ease, I paired with an rx 7900 xtx and forgot about frame rate drops and stuttering.","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Great cpu","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Processor","Core™ i7-14700KF"

This processor is ridiculously fast and handles everything we would expect it to. Cyberpunk picked up 10fps with a 3080 but runs super smooth now at 4k with RT. I did pair this with a z790 Aorus and 32gb ddr5 6400.******** AT Own Risk*******  Suggest undervolting in bios if you know what you are doing. I am running this cpu 5.7 all cores - 1.24v on a custom loop. I see idle temps 31c - gaming 60c and cinebench 89c.  It will run hot if you're on air and do not adjust the default voltage.

"R292IQUXEFIS98","The besto reviewer random","A very powerful processor, but if it does not have good cooling, its functions will be limited. Currently it is working wonders together with the other components. But if they have a moderate cooling system, it is advisable to use the other brand of processors ""AMD"" that has half the temperatures, but with 10% to 20% less performance in some activities, and with the defects that come with not have an architecture that self-protects well or do not update its software often for better handling.Finally, I recommend the processor, only if you have a processor that does not meet current needs. My I7 6700k can do it all, but for some specific technologies, such as SSD Gen 4, peripherals with high-speed USB - C and others, it couldn't cope.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2023","High TDP and Temperatures","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Processor","Core™ i7-14700KF"
"R1QRY4UENV59KI","AJ","I got this CPU because I've been a long term Intel user and I have never had problems with them. This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3). In terms of power consumption and heat generation, I can hardly notice it since all the workload I put on it hardly heats it up more than 45C-50C. I'm not a video/photo content creator nor a streamer, so this works for me. For example, while playing COD MW3 and Ultra settings the CPU use is about 2% while my GPU, RTX 3080, carries 98% of the bottleneck workload.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","Works Great for High End Gaming and Average Workloads","5.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Processor","Core™ i5-14600K"

Recommend no smaller than a 360 cooler, I went Artic due to the increased width of their radiator core. Top temp (tuned) 95c but will play most games in the 65c range. VR put a greater heat of 91c max but the flight sim was beautiful and smooth as can be with water takeoffs and landings. This was an upgrade to a 12700kf that I chose awaiting the 14 generation processors. I have this combined with a Nvidea 4080 on a MSI z690 board with 64gb ddr4.
