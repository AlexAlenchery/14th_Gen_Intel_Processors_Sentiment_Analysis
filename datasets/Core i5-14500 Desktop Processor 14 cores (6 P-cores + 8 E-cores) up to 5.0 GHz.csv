"R14JQ5LGYUNS88","Mark Johnson","The CPU works great, but it was constantly 90C-100C on light duty.Definitely buy an aftermarket cooler.  The intel specs say 154watt power consumption on max load, so 150watt cooler may not be quite enough.I didn't want to take a chance and purchased a dual tower air cooler rated at +250w cooling.  It runs very cool and quiet.","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024","Cooler is inadequate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","9","Computer Processor"
"ROBZBSVZQ3LEV","Carey Holzman","This is a great product at a great price that runs cool with the included cooler. However, every motherboard manufacturer is now OVER VOLTING the CPUs causing them to run hotter and be less efficient so they can pass benchmarks with slightly higher scores at the cost of cooking your CPU. Look up the PL1 (long term power) and PL2 (short term power) ratings for your CPU and compare it to the massive over-volting your motherboard is doing to it without your knowledge or consent.In this case, the PL1 on a 14500 is 65w and the PL2 is 154w. My AsRock board was over-volting this to 219w+!!! No wonder it was cooking the CPU. This is not even an over-clockable CPU!There is a setting in the AsRock BIOS EZ screen to ENABLE INTEL POWER LIMITS, but it does not work! You need to go to advanced settings and find the long and short power limits and put them back MANUALLY to Intel's specifications.Now your chip will not over-heat, will cost less money to run, will last longer, be more reliable and you do NOT need to waste your money on more expensive coolers or thermal paste, nor waste your time installing and wiring all that up!!!!!!!","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","Included CPU cooler is great if you know your motherboard is over-volting your CPU by default","5.0 out of 5 stars","","14","Computer Processor"
"R27E0HGV5GAYZG","SR_Amazon","The CPU performs great.  Good price.  Probably not for gaming, but I'm not a gamer.The cooler is not sufficient for this CPU.  I had to buy a better one.  I am happy with this one:ID-COOLING SE-224-XTS CPU Cooler 4 Heatpipes CPU Air Cooler 120mm PWM Fan CPU Fan for Intel LGA1700/115X/1200; AMD AM4/AM5I wish Intel would not include the cooler and give the false impression that it will be fine.  Don't cook your CPU; just buy a better one.","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2024","Great CPU, horrible cooler.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Computer Processor"
"R3H9K14BIWC77G","Billy","This is an upgrade from a 4 core processor I used to have. This CPU feels super fast in comparison. I really love it!I use this for gaming, I've never seen it get even close to 100% usage, but I don't play anything too demanding or at max settings.The fan that it comes with it's a little bit loud, but not enough to bother me, specially since I game with my headphones on. But I like that it comes with thermal paste pre-applied.","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","Amazing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Computer Processor"
"RBDWCY47PIREY","Jason","This was an impulse purchase, but I'm glad I did it. The stock fan that comes with it is quieter than I was expecting, and installation was a snap.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024","Impulse purchase","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Computer Processor"
"R151KM6O7AH9MD","Yibo Sun","Switched to 14500 since my itx build cant handle 13900K, turned out I don’t feel any difference, and the fans don’t need to spin at full speed thus much quieter. For those who do casual office work and surf internet, watch youtube, play casual games, 14500 is very good choice.","Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","Good for most office use and  games","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Computer Processor"

"R1HZZONW7BOPV3","IammE","I love the chip but I noticed something strange. The stock cooler had hardened thermal paste on it. It looks like this was used and resold at a new price. I have never seen a stock cooler come with thermal paste on it and especially not hardened crusty thermal paste. I had to clean it off with rubbing alcohol. Other than that, the chip is a good one and a nice balance between great performance and efficiency with its 65 TDP. I just can't believe that the stock cooler had thermal paste on it and it appears to be used. I have never had that happen before.","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2024","I love the chip but.....","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Computer Processor"
