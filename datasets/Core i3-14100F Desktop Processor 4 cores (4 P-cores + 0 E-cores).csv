"RDKIQ0HH9G3JA","Garrett","A lot of people will say that i3s are not enough in 2024 and can't run anything. Couldn't be further from the truth. This cpu is good enough more than 90-95% of people. If you know this cpu isn't powerful enough for your work, then you are in that 5%.For gaming and for basic office/school work, this cpu is unmatched when it comes to price vs performance. The cooler it comes with had an interesting mounting mechanism but it keeps my CPU nice and cool. I've been playing Hogwart's Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 at 1080p on ultra settings with my Arc A580.Also I managed to snag this at $95 brand new, so basically I was forced to buy it at that point or facepalm myself.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 June 2024","Great for gaming, don't listen to the everyone saying it's not enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Computer Processor"

"R3JVZTXU8DXMZP","Jon281","A friend told me he was running Tekken 8 on a 12th gen i3, so that was enough for me to switch my plans over to Intel.This 14th gen is incrementally faster than the previous generations but cost about the same.So far no problems, seems like a good chip.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 February 2024","Cost/benefit ratio better than a comparable AMD","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Computer Processor"
