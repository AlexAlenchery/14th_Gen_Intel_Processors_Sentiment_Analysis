It had a low end intel CPU to start and I figured i would just upgrade to this instead of switching over to AMD again. Works wonderfully and it got rid of a bottleneck with the old CPU.","Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","Works great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",

"R1QQ843F2TKPBT","Wythe","I ordered 14700F because I need a CPU that has similar performance compared with 14700k but consumes less power, and I was wrong about it.1st of all, the CPU cooler come with the CPU is too weak and it limit the CPU to 65w with continuously load.The 65w power limitation severely undercut CPU performance and I get about 20,000 with Cinebench R23.A powerful cooler is definitely needed to cool down the CPU allowing it to run at 220w.With 220w on the 14700F, Cinebench R23 score has reached 33,000.For me, when 14700f paired with the original cooler, the 65w CPU is too weak for my need.In the meantime, with a powerful cooler, 14700f performs close (but not as fast) as 14700k and the 220w power consumption is not much difference compared with 14700kf's 250w PL2.Considering the price between 14700f and 14700kf, there is not much wattage difference between them.With this reason, I have decided to return it.Bottom line,For a price conscious buyer, then I think I5 is better choice because it is cheaper but performs similar compared to 14700f run at 65 watt.If you need more computing power like me, then I think14700k is a better buy.","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024","Not for me but it is a good CPU","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0",
