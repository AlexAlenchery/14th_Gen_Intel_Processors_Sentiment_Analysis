"RMRCN4AEKANH9","DUBNASTY","The Intel® Core™ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor arrives with much anticipation, boasting impressive specifications on paper. However, a closer examination reveals that this processor falls short of delivering the expected value for its price tag.At first glance, the i9-14900KS appears promising, with its high clock speeds and purported performance enhancements. However, when put to the test, it becomes evident that the marginal improvements over its predecessors do not justify the hefty price premium attached to it.One of the major drawbacks of the i9-14900KS is its lackluster performance gains in real-world scenarios. Despite the incremental upgrades in clock speeds and architecture, users may find that the difference in performance compared to previous generations is negligible in most tasks, from gaming to content creation.Moreover, the i9-14900KS faces stiff competition from rival processors, such as those from AMD's Ryzen lineup, which offer comparable performance at a more reasonable price point. In terms of value for money, the i9-14900KS simply does not measure up, as consumers can find better alternatives that provide similar or even superior performance without breaking the bank.Furthermore, the i9-14900KS's power consumption and thermal management remain areas of concern. Despite being marketed as a high-performance processor, it tends to run hot under heavy workloads, requiring robust cooling solutions to prevent thermal throttling and maintain stable operation.In conclusion, while the Intel® Core™ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor may appeal to enthusiasts seeking the latest and greatest hardware, its lack of significant performance improvements and unfavorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a hard sell for the average consumer. With more cost-effective options available on the market, investing in the i9-14900KS may not be the wisest decision for those looking to maximize their computing power without breaking the bank.","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2024","Disappointing Performance-to-Price Ratio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","16",
"R2OBBE1B0U1OU5","Aaron Brittain","Thought I'd give the CPU a try despite the reviews, hoping that the kinks had been ironed out since the stability problems had come to light. Nope. First day was fine, games worked great, CPU worked flawlessly. The next morning, first game I booted up crashed. Thought that was odd, tried again, and crashed again. Within about 15 minutes, I could no longer even open games that used UE5. Constant crashing in other CPU heavy tasks. I spent 8 hours troubleshooting my PC and doing research into the issue to come to the conclusion that everyone else having these symptoms also had i9-13900/14900 KS CPUs. Despite following the advice from ASUS and applying the intel CPU profile in the UEFI, the problems have returned and continue to get worse.Save your money, and save yourself the frustration and heartache, buy a different CPU.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024","Listen to the reviews","1.0 out of 5 stars","","8",
"R2ORUKVOH435JC","Danny Lim","Performance and stability was excellent. I was able to achieve 5.9 Ghz by default stock clockspeed with my air cooler Noctua NH-D15. Yes, I had to adjust System Voltage via BIOS to ensure system stability, otherwise the game will crash which I recommend to set it between 1.11 V - 1.15V, otherwise leaving it by default may push SA voltage to around 2.10 - 3.00 V which is very dangerous to your memory controller. Yes, IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) does matter when it comes to RAM overclocking, however, not all RAM and CPU can achieve same clockspeed and volage due to silicon lottery. Other than that, I'm happy with the results, able to run much higher framerate, no frame drop during livestreaming via OBS and works perfectly fine with ASUS Apex Encore Z790 Motherboard.P.S.  You may have to turn on Intel SVID default behavior to ensure system stability which you may have to download & flash the latest UEFI BIOS, regardless your motherboard vendor such as ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE, EVGA, Biostar, etc.All in all, I recommend this product if you have sufficient cooling but also want to achieve much higher clock speed via better binning. But nevertheless, everything comes down to silicon lottery.","Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024","You pay for higher binning!","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",

Even tried it on two boards same thing the Apex Encore and the Rog Strix z790-E.... that both my 13900k and 14000k work on flawlessly.

For you builders, I would suggest the following for a solid build. It is also what I am running. G.Skill 6800 ram that does run at 6800 using TMP of course in your bios, Sabrent Rocket 8Tb, Asus Hero Black, 1200-Watt Asus PS and a Gforce  4090. That combination has worked flawlessly for me.

"R2181WYH16L7IF","Christopher Rose","Great CPU. You’re basically paying a premium to get the best binned part. Only problem is Intel love to shove power into these chips, causing extreme temperatures. Before I undervolted it, I was getting over 90 C and hitting 100 C at times. But since the KS has the highest bin, It is super easy to undervolt.","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","You Pay More For The Higher Bin","5.0 out of 5 stars","","3",
"RW2BX2HQCO2W6","Sam","This is for the 14900ks. I had to order 3 before I received a stable one. The problematic chips would power off my system randomly which only increased in frequency. They also wouldn’t be stable even with Intel’s baseline profile. No amount of thermal grease, reseating or troubleshooting would fix it. If you want this chip be prepared to go through a few returns before you get a good one. For the stable 14900ks it decently edges out my 13900k. It gives a little extra processing power for single core performance. Which is exactly what I needed for my audio processing.Performance comes at a cost. This chip runs hot. 90c under load with 420mm Arctic AIO and Kryonaut extreme.  Although I have one core which is a top performer and doesn’t exceed 82c .

I didn't realize this was such an unstable CPU when I bought it, then the more I used it and more research I did I finally realized that this CPU is unstable and was pushed to the physical limit. Don't get your hopes up, maybe you'll get a lucky CPU and you know how to stabilize it via bios. Realized too late to return, so I have to RMA and hopefully I get a CPU that have issues such as; crashes, freeze, out of video memory error, blue screen, lose tabs, open app then crash, open twice to open program, etc etc problems. Idk I just feel let down by intel on this one. My CPU is not stable with intel baseline defaults for this KS chip which is the extreme, and thats what I paid for so..... yeah if you know what youre doing maybe get it, but if you don't have the BIOS mastery to fix this CPU I would idk, reconsider.

"R20Q03OJF1F2IN","Andrew S","Go ahead and take a chance at getting a very efficient 14900K.If you're set on Intel, I personally enjoy the value of being able to run similar speed as a regular 14900K, but with significantly less voltage. This, in turn, allows your system to run cooler and more quiet. Although you will always be subject to silicon lottery, the 14900KS seems to have a better memory controller than the regular 14900K on average(as it should) as well.The value of the premium cost on the KS models will always be a subjective choice. $200 extra for 5.9ghz all core and an extra 1 or 2 speed bins on your memory out of the box worth it?

"R1WQM9T3DJY6JI","Ninja","I've had the worst luck with 14th Gen i9 bins. After only 1 month of overall decent stability, I'm just now starting to get random CRC failures when extracting archives, blue screens, game crashes; even despite having run on Intel's new power profiles since the start (from post-May-deadline set by Intel on Motherboard manufacturers) designed to avoid damaging the CPUs while Intel explores their RMA nightmare; and this CPU still managed to experience serious degradation not unlike other high end i9s in the Raptor Lake Refresh.I've already upgraded from a 14900K to a 14900KS (14900K lasted 6 months before RMA too), but this 14900KS here only lasted less than 30 days before 14th gen CPU-gate issues struck again, and it is absolutely eating this new 14900KS alive.Edit: As of this writing (June 15 2014), there is a microcode update that Intel will be pushing to BIOS vendors to fix a bug in CPU causing the CPU's Extended Adaptive Thermal Boost parameters to be set too high, which apparently is a contributing factor.  I don't believe it will necessarily fix the sudden physical depredation that my CPU has already undergone, however, I would advise anyone interested to steer clear of 14th Gen i9's until Intel has root-caused the hardware issues to prevent anyone getting stuck in a ""try-break-RMA-repeat"" support loop until this is all more understood.I miss having a reliable CPU, but right now this one ain't it.","Reviewed in Canada on June 15, 2024","CRC Failures, Blue Screens, Crashes","1.0 out of 5 stars","","2",
