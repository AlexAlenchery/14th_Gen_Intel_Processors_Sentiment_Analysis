"R1IV0H0D5EECBD","Token Firefly","Don't let the naysayers talk you down from this CPU. It has everything you'd want at an amazing value to performance ratio - pair it with any GPU released in the last 6 years and you'll be able to run just about anything at mid-high settings in 1080p-1440p. If you can get on sale too, so much the better.Runs stable and cool even when over locked - just be aware that there's no integrated graphics on this, so you need a dedicated GPU to post if you're building a new rig.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2024","Underrated CPU at a Competitive Price","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Desktop Processor"
